# Python-Challenge
Module 3 Challenge

SOURCE CODE
All code was written from a combination of in-class sessions as well as previous python class. The only code I believe that was NOT explicitly gone over in class was ".diff()" to find the differences from one month to the next in PyBank

Both programs are very similar in form and function as there wasn't much difference between what was being asked. e.g. Read csv file, loop through a column to find specific values, perform some basic math, and output to console/write to a new file.





(Unsure of exactly what to include in this README file so please provide feedback if anything is out of place)
